"""
This file is intended to generate tags on script information
What I mean by "tags" is derivative features - that is, features
which are generated as derivatives of other scripts. One example of
such a feature would be source lines of code, or number of loops.
This script should process a python "job" (mostly just python scripts for now)
and add those "tags" to a data file about them.
